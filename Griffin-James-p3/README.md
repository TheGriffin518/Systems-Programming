# DISCLAIMER
I ran out of time with certain regards, so there are many functions that
are not avaible. Not all of the builtin commands work and the ones that 
I have implemented I am not sure if they work either. Overall there are
many things that I am unsure of as to whether they work as intended or 
not. 

Also due to finals and other things going on in my life, I was extremely 
exhausted when doing parts of this project, so documentation is not done
well and some things are very confusing. I apologize for that. 

# INSTRUCTIONS
In order to compile, type '$ make' and the make file will compile and link
all of the necessary files together.

In order to run the shell program, type '$ ./1730sh' and it will begin. The
shell displays your current working directory.
