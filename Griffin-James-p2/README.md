# Project 3

In order to compile, use the make utility within the directory
that contains the make file. Typing '$ make' will make all of 
the executables and place them in the current directory. In order
to run the programs, type '$ ./ ' with the program you wish to run.
For example, '$ ./ls' will run the ls.cpp program.

I was unable to get the cp -r function to work. It works normally when the
 '-r' flag is not used. I am unsure why this 
occurred. I was unable to figure out why this happened.
