## Instructions 

To compile my code, type '$ make' and the Makefile will compile
and link the program. It will compile and link to an executable
named "p1". 

To run the code, type '$ ./p1' and the code will run. 

The p1 file demonstrates the usage of my Matrix.cpp file. When run it shows 
somes operations that have been done with it.
